# Coded-Quiz (Code Quiz)


## Description

>This is a simple quiz app about coding. This app is opened using live server in the html file. When the server starts, the user is presented with the landing page which contains the quiz title *Coding Quiz*, a short description about the app and a timer which starts once the "start quiz" button is hit. The timer will count down from 60 seconds to 0 and 10 seconds will be taken away for every wrong answer submitted into the quiz. <br> Once the quiz ends the user will be promted to input their initials into a text field that ecords scores and is saved into the app. The different questions are read and rendered using <br>
*Currently the app only has a timer which does start from 60 and counts down to 0 but it starts as soon as the page is loaded. Also the start quiz question is working and rendering the questions but it's currently limited to only one and starting over so i'll be working to develop a fully functioning question app in the near future.*
